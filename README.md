# Install Party

This is a project that creates and manages ephemeral servers for install parties/workshops of Matrix homeservers.

## Install and run

Installing Install Party is done by cloning its Git repository and installing its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babolivier/install-party.git
cd install-party
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then it can be run with:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
./install_party.py [mode] [options]
```

## Creation mode

The creation mode (`create`) uses the OpenStack and OVH APIs to create a new host, attach a domain to it, and run a script that installs Riot and Caddy on it, so that an attendee can log in (with SSH) with the configured username and password, install a new homeserver, and directly use it with the Riot instance.

The OpenStack instance name will be `{namespace}-{name}` and the domain name will be `{name}.{namespace}.{zone}`, where:

* `{namespace}` is a configured namespace (e.g. the event's name as a slug)
* `{zone}` is a configured DNS zone (must be managed by OVH)
* `{name}` is the host's name (either provided, e.g. `install_party.py create foo`, or a randomly generated 5-letter string) 

Note: currently, if attendees wish/need to use a homeserver's built-in ACME support, they **must** set the post the ACME support listener is listening to to `8888`.

## Configuration

The configuration is provided as a YAML configuration file. By default, a file named `config.yaml` in the current directory will be used, but this can be overridden by setting the environment variable `INSTALL_PARTY_CONFIG` to the path of the desired file.

The configuration file's content must follow the following structure. Currently, all fields are mandatory.

```yaml
# General configuration that's not specific to a section.
general:
  # Namespace to use when creating/listing the instances and DNS records.
  namespace: my-super-event
  # DNS zone to create the DNS records on.
  dns_zone: example.com
  # The version of Riot to install on the hosts.
  riot_version: v1.4.2

# Configuration specific to the instances.
instances:
  # User the attendee will use when logging into the host with SSH.
  # Must already exist on the system.
  user: superevent
  # Password the attendee will use when logging into the host with SSH.
  password: superevent2019
